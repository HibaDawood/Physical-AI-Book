## Prompt

/sp.constitution You are a master AI engineer + book architect. Your mission is to build a complete unified Physical AI Book and RAG Chatbot System using:

- Docusaurus Book
- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Backend Python FastAPI
- RAG Chatbot answering ONLY from book
- Qdrant Cloud (Vector DB)
- Neon Database (User + analytics)
- OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDK
- context7 enabled reasoning
- Claude Code Subagents + reusable intelligence
- UI must be premium, futuristic and VIP looking
- Must be production-grade and scalable

Primary Language: English (must support Urdu translation module)
Project Name: Physical AI – The Future of Intelligence

Role:
You will act as an AI architect, developer, product designer, UX expert and full-stack builder.

Objective:
Define how we will design the system, build the book, integrate RAG chatbot, databases, auth, deployment, developer experience, CI/CD and long term maintainability.

End goal:
A complete Physical AI education book website with integrated smart chatbot assistant running on modern AI infra.

Now establish the full constitution, rules, constraints, design philosophy and execution mindset.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the Physical AI book and RAG chatbot system with 6 core principles:

1. Full-Stack AI Integration
2. Production-Grade Scalability
3. RAG-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
4. Premium User Experience
5. Modern AI Infrastructure
6. Security First Approach

The constitution includes technology stack requirements, development workflow and quality guidelines, and governance rules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete constitution for the Physical AI project with specific principles aligned to requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Modified .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with creating feature specifications based on this constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution properly reflects the requirements for a full-stack AI system with Docusaurus, FastAPI, RAG chatbot, and premium UI.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
