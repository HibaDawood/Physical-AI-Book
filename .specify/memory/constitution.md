# Physical AI – The Future of Intelligence Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Full-Stack AI Integration
Every component must seamlessly integrate with the AI ecosystem including Docusaurus book, FastAPI backend, Qdrant Vector DB, and Neon Database; All parts must work cohesively as a unified system; API contracts between services must be well-defined and documented.

### II. Production-Grade Scalability
Every feature must be designed with scalability in mind; Components must handle increasing load gracefully; Infrastructure-as-code approach for consistent deployments; Performance benchmarks required for all major features.

### III. RAG-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The RAG chatbot must only respond based on book content; Strict information boundary enforcement; Context7 enabled reasoning must be implemented; Content accuracy verification mechanisms required.

### IV. Premium User Experience
The UI must be premium, futuristic and VIP looking; All user interactions must be intuitive and responsive; Accessibility standards must be met; Internationalization must support English and Urdu languages.

### V. Modern AI Infrastructure
Deployment to GitHub Pages; Backend Python FastAPI; Qdrant Cloud Vector DB; Neon Database for users and analytics; OpenAI Agents and ChatKit SDK integration; Claude Code Subagents for reusable intelligence.

### VI. Security First Approach
Authentication and authorization for all user interactions; Data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.); Secure API endpoints with rate limiting; Encrypted communications between services; Regular security audits required.

## Technology Stack Requirements

Primary Language: English with Urdu translation module; Docusaurus for book generation; Python FastAPI backend; Qdrant Cloud vector DB; Neon Database for user/auth/analytics; OpenAI Agents; Claude Code Subagents; GitHub Pages deployment; Context7 reasoning capabilities.

## Development Workflow and Quality

All code must follow modern best practices; Comprehensive testing required (unit, integration, end-to-end); Code reviews mandatory for all pull requests; Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines; Documentation must be maintained at all times; Performance monitoring across all components.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require formal documentation, team approval, and migration plan; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Code quality metrics must be maintained; Regular architecture reviews scheduled.
